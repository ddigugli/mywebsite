        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Drew DiGuglielmo and I am currently a student at the
            University of Notre Dame studying Computer Science. I was born and raised
            in Westchester, New York where I attended John Jay High School in Cross River, 
            New York and spent much of my life painting shoes, playing sports, and babysitting.
        </p>
        <p>I played soccer, lacrosse, and skiing. I only took up freestyle skiing for 
            a few seasons, and now do the sport when I have freetime. Lacrosse was more for fun,
            I participated from 5th to 8th grade and then again my senior year of high school.
            Soccer has been part of life since I was three years old. I was recognized my
            sophomore, junior, and senior year with awards in <span class="awards">All-League Honorable Mention,
            All-League, and All-Section</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Here at Notre Dame I spend most of my time with my ROTC responsibilities. I 
            was recently accepted into the <span class="awards">Cyber Warfare Summer Training</span>, which is a highly
            competitive and difficult program to be accepted into. This training, upon leaving 
            a good impression, will help me with my service selection senior year. I hope
            to commission into this community where I will be trained and become an expert in
            analyzing, processing, and reporting real-time signal intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
